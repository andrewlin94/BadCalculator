Bad Calculator as practice with C++.

This was worked on using Visual Studio Code with C/C++ extension. Standard is C++11. Can be changed in tasks.json.

2018/11/25: Catch2 added for testing. Make sure to run task to build Catch2 before running tests to reduce compile time.

Json files are to configure the extension.

For c_cpp_properties.json, modify "compilerPath" to the path of your gcc, depending on your OS.
